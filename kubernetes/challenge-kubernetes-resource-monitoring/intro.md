Prometheus is an open-source instrumentation framework that can absorb massive amounts of data every second. This property makes Prometheus well-suited for monitoring complex workloads.

Use Prometheus to monitor your servers, VMs, and databases and draw on that data to analyze the performance of your applications and infrastructure.

The challenge was to deploy Prometheus and Grafana in Kubernetes.
