# Move Files

In this challenge, we will use the `mv` command, which is used to move files or directories in a Linux system.

The folder `challenge3` was created on Desktop. It contains a file named `mytextfile.txt`. We will move this file to the current directory using the `mv` command.

## TODO

- Change the mod bits of the directory `challenge3` to `777`.
- Move the file `mytextfile.txt` to the current directory.

## Requirements

- You should work on the Linux terminal in the `challenge3` directory.
- The `mytextfile.txt` file must be moved using the `mv` command.
- You should rename the moved file.

## Hint

Use `sudo` to get root privileges.
Use `chmod` to change mod bits.
