# Copy Files

In this challenge, we will use the `cp` command, which is used to copy files or directories in a Linux system.

The folder `challenge2` was created on Desktop. It contains a file named `mytextfile.txt`. We will copy this file to the current directory using the `cp` command.

- You should work on the Linux terminal in the `challenge2` directory.
- The `mytextfile.txt` file must be copied using the `cp` command.
- You should rename the copied file.
