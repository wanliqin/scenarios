# Getting Started

Before we dive into the different multiplication operations in NumPy, let's first open the Python shell by typing the following command in the terminal.

```bash
python3
```

then import the library and create some sample arrays that we can use for demonstration.

```python
import numpy as np

# Creating sample arrays
A = np.array([[1, 2], [3, 4]])
B = np.array([[5, 6], [7, 8]])
```

We have created two arrays `A` and `B`, each with two rows and two columns. Now, let's explore the different multiplication operations available in NumPy.
