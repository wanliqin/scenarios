# numpy.multiply

The `numpy.multiply` function performs element-wise multiplication between two arrays. The two arrays must have the same shape. The resulting array will have the same shape as the input arrays.

```python
C = np.multiply(A, B)

print(C)
# Output:
# array([[ 5, 12],
#       [21, 32]])
```

In this example, each element in `A` is multiplied with the corresponding element in `B`, resulting in the element-wise multiplication of the two arrays.
