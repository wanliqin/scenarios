# NumPy Einsum

In scientific computing, it is often necessary to perform various linear algebra operations. NumPy is a popular Python library that provides efficient and convenient tools for performing such operations. One of the most powerful tools in NumPy is `einsum`, which stands for Einstein Summation.

In this tutorial, we will learn what `einsum` is and how to use it effectively in Python.
