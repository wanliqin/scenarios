# Install JDK

## Introduction

Jenkins is developed in Java, so its runtime environment requires JDK.

There are various ways to install JDK, such as binary installation, source package installation, etc. Since our challenge environment is Ubuntu, which has java repositories, it is easiest to install directly using the apt command.

## Target
