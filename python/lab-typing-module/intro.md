# Typing Module

In this tutorial, you will learn how to use the Python `typing` module to add type hints to your code. Type hints help make your code more readable and maintainable by explicitly indicating your functions' expected input and output types.

## Introduction to Type Hints

Type hints are a feature introduced in Python 3.5, and the `typing` module was added in Python 3.5.2 to provide a standard set of type annotations. Import the relevant types from the `typing` module to start using type hints.

```python
from typing import List, Tuple, Dict
```
