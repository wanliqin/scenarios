# Asynchronous Tasks with apply_async()

In this programming challenge, you will be using Python multiprocessing to perform asynchronous tasks using the `apply_async()` method.

Your solution should include:

1. Your program should use the `multiprocessing.Pool()` class and the `apply_async()` method to submit a function call to the pool of processes for each number in the range from 0 to 9.
2. You should also use a callback function to retrieve the result of the function call when it is ready.

## Examples

Your program should output the squares of the numbers 0 to 9 in any order.

## TODO

- Completing `slow_square.py`

## Requirements

- Your code should be well-documented and easy to read.
- You should use the `unittest` module to test your code.
- Your code should be modular and well-organized, with each challenge separated.
