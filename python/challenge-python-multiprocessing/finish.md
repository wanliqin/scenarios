# Summary

In this challenge, you try using Python multiprocessing to run processes in parallel. You started with a simple program that demonstrated how multiprocessing works, and then moved on to more complex examples that used multiprocessing to speed up processing and share memory between processesand perform asynchronous tasks using `apply_async()`.
