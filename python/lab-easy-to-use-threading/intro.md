# Easy To Use Threading

In this tutorial, we will learn how to use Python's threading module to run multiple threads of execution concurrently.

## Introduction

Python's threading module provides a simple way to create and manage threads in a Python program. A thread is a separate flow of execution within a program. By running multiple threads concurrently, we can take advantage of multi-core CPUs and improve the performance of our programs.

The threading module provides two classes for creating and managing threads:

1. `Thread` class: This class represents a single thread of execution.
2. `Lock` class: This class allows synchronizing access to shared resources between threads.
