# Put Fruit Into Basket

There is a basket that can hold 10 fruit.
You have to enter the weight of the fruits from the command line and put them into the basket. If the total weight is greater than 10, return the total weight as a string and a list of fruits that have been put into the basket.

Here is the input example:

```bash
Enter the weight of the fruit: 2
Enter the weight of the fruit: hello
Enter the weight of the fruit: 5.354
Enter the weight of the fruit: 3

# return value
7.35, [2, 5.354]
```

## TODO

- Completing `put_fruits.py`

## Requirements

- If the input value is not a numeric value or is less than 0, skip it directly.
- The total weight return value must be rounded to two decimal places.
