# Simple Shopping Cart

In this case study, you will build a simple shopping cart system using Python. The goal is to practice object-oriented programming concepts, such as classes, methods, and inheritance. You will create a `Product` class to represent items in the cart and a `ShoppingCart` class to manage adding, removing, and calculating the total cost of products in the cart. Additionally, you will implement functionality to apply discounts to the cart.

By completing this case, you will gain a deeper understanding of Python classes, methods, and object-oriented programming principles.
