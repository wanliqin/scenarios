# Create a Product Class

In this step, you will create a Product class that will represent items in a shopping cart. The Product class should have two attributes: name and price.

### Example

```python
product = Product("Apple", 0.5)
print(product.name)  # Output: "Apple"
print(product.price)  # Output: 0.5
```

### Requirements

1. Create a `Product` class with a constructor that takes two arguments: `name` and `price`.
2. The `name` argument should be a string, while the `price` argument should be a float.
3. Add appropriate docstrings and type hints for the constructor.
