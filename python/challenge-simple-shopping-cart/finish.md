# Summary

In this case study, you have built a simple shopping cart system with the following features:

1. Created a `Product` class to represent items in the shopping cart, with attributes for name and price.
2. Created a `ShoppingCart` class to manage adding and removing products and calculating the total cost of products in the cart.
3. Implemented functionality to apply percentage-based and fixed-amount discounts to the shopping cart.

Throughout the case, you have practiced using Python classes, methods, docstrings, and type hints. This case study serves as a solid foundation for learning more advanced object-oriented programming concepts and applying them to real-world Python projects.
