# Area Calculation

In this step, modify the main method to accept user input for the shape type and shape length, and then return the shape name and area.
The format is as follows:

```bash
Please input shape type(1: circle, 2: square) and length with space to split: 1 10
The circle area is: 28.26 # ouput shape and area
```

## Tips:

- The shape types are as follows: 1: circle; 2: square. if a value other than 1 and 2 is entered, `Invalid shape type` is printed.

## TODO

- Completing `area.py`

## Requirements

- Implement the `get_input()` and `cal_area()` methods.
- Must create `Square` and `Circle` object in `cal_area()` method.
