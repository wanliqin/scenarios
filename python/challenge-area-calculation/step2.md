# Subclass and Override

Following the first step, here we first create two subclasses `Circle` and `Square` which inherit from `Shape` and both implement the `area()` method.

## TODO

- Completing `subclass.py`

## Requirements

- Write the code for two subclasses of `Shape` and implement their area methods.
- The `area()` method of the `Circle` class returns `3.14 * length * length`, and the `area()` method of the `Square` class returns the square of the length.
