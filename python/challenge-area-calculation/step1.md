# Class and Method

There is a class named `Shape` which has a property called length and a public method called `area()` for calculating the area. The `length` is passed to the constructor when the object is created. At this step, the call to `area()` is not completed and will throw a `NotImplementedError` exception when called.

## TODO

- Completing `shape.py`

## Requirements

- Implement the `Shape` class, which takes a length parameter in its constructor.
- Write an `area()` method of the `Shape` class that throws a `NotImplementedError` when called.
