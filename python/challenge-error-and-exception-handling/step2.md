# Graceful Error Recovery

In this sub-challenge, you will implement graceful error recovery mechanisms that allow your program to continue running even when an exception is encountered.

## Purpose

The goal of this sub-challenge is to teach you how to create robust programs that can handle errors and exceptions gracefully without crashing or terminating unexpectedly.

There is a piece of code in `graceful_error_recovery.py` that uses a decorator function to implement an exponential retreat method to retry the function, exit the function when the number of retries exceeds `max_retries`, and write an `error` log. The exceptions are explained in the function explanation of the corresponding function.

## Requirements

- Implement a retry mechanism for handling temporary failures.
- Implement fallbacks for critical operations that cannot be completed due to errors.

## TODO

- Completing `/home/labex/project/graceful_error_recovery.py`
- Identify the parts of your code that may raise temporary exceptions and implement a retry mechanism with exponential backoff.
- For critical operations, implement fallbacks to ensure your program continues to function even if the operation fails.
- Use try-except blocks to handle exceptions, recover gracefully from errors, and write to the logging system. The logging module log output is in the function description of the file.
