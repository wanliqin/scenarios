# Automated Testing and Error Simulation

In this sub-challenge, you will create automated tests for your program and simulate various error conditions to ensure your error handling mechanisms work as expected.

## Purpose

This sub-challenge aims to teach you how to create comprehensive test cases and simulate error conditions to validate your program's error handling capabilities.

## Requirements

- Create test cases for your program using the unittest module.
- Simulate error conditions in your test cases to validate your error handling mechanisms.
- Ensure your test cases cover a wide range of scenarios and edge cases.

## TODO

- Completing `/home/labex/project/graceful_error_recovery.py`
- Write test cases for your program using the unittest module.
- In your test cases, simulate various error conditions to ensure your error handling mechanisms work as expected.
- Make sure to cover different scenarios and edge cases to test the robustness of your program.

## Tips

- You can use the `patch` function under the `unittest.mock` module to prevent the `sleep` function from sleeping.
