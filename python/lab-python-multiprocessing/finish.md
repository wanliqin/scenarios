# Summary

In this lab, you learned how to use Python multiprocessing to run processes in parallel. You started with a simple program that demonstrated how multiprocessing works, and then moved on to more complex examples that used multiprocessing to speed up processing and share memory between processesand perform asynchronous tasks using `apply_async()`. By the end of this lab, you should have a good understanding of how to use multiprocessing in your own Python programs to achieve greater processing power and efficiency,and to communicate between processes when necessary.
