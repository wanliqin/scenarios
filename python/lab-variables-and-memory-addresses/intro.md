# Variables and Memory Addresses

In this tutorial, we will explore Python variables, memory addresses, and the differences between mutable and immutable data types:

- **Immutable data types**: These data types cannot be changed after creation. Examples include `int`, `float`, `str`, `tuple`, and `frozenset`.
- **Mutable data types**: These data types can be modified after creation. Examples include `list`, `dict`, and `set`.

With immutable data types, any changes result in a new object being created, while mutable data types can be modified in place. Understanding this distinction is crucial when working with memory addresses and variable assignment.

We will cover variable assignment, the characteristics of mutable and immutable data types, and the `is` operator for comparing memory addresses. Let's begin!
