# Summary

In this advanced tutorial, we took a deep dive into Python variables and memory addresses. Variable assignment, mutable and immutable data types were also discussed together. In addition, the `is` operator for comparing memory addresses and the built-in function id(), which returns a unique identifier for an object, were used. We also practiced these concepts through hands-on exercises. Understanding these advanced concepts will help you become a more proficient Python programmer because it provides more insight into how Python manages memory and how variables function at a deeper level.
