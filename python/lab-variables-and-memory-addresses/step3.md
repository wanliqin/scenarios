# 'is' operator and built-in function 'id()'

 First, let's look at some sample code together that illustrates the use of the is operator, comparing the memory addresses of two objects:

```python
x = [1, 2, 3]
y = [1, 2, 3]
z = x
print(x is y)   # False, because x and y have different memory addresses
print(x is z)   # True, because x and z have the same memory address
```

## To recap

In Python, the is operator compares the memory addresses of two objects. If the memory addresses are the same, the is operator returns True; otherwise, it returns False. this is different from the == operator, which compares the values of objects.

## Then, let's look at some sample code that illustrates the use of the built-in function id()

```python
print(id(x))     # Output the unique identifier of the x object
print(id(y))     # output the unique identifier of the y object, as opposed to x
print(id(z))     # output the unique identifier of the z object, which is the same as x
```

## To summarize

In Python, id() is a built-in function that can be used to return a unique identifier for a given object. This identifier is an integer that remains constant for the lifetime of the object. That is, if two objects have the same identifier, then they are the same object, and vice versa.

### In summary

It is important to note that the is operator compares the memory addresses of two objects, while the == operator compares the values of two objects. Therefore, when using the is operator to compare objects, you need to be aware that the memory addresses of different objects may be the same, while when using the == operator to compare objects, you need to be aware that the memory addresses of objects with the same value may be different.
