# Fake Person Objects and Sort in Age

Create five `Person` objects and sort them by `age`. Then print the sorted objects using the `Fake` library installed in the first step.

## TODO

- Completing `fake_person.py`

## Requirements

- Use the `faker` library to generate the `name`, `age` and `email` for a person.
- Create the appropriate number of `Person` objects based on the given parameters.
- Before returning, the `Person` objects must be sorted in ascending order by `age`.
