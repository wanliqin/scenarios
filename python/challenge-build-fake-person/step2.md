# Build Person Class

Please implement a `Person` class that contains the fields `name`, `age` and `email`. Also implement a `getAge()` method that returns the age of the user.

## TODO

- Completing `person.py`

## Requirements

- Complete the constructor method of the `Person` class and accept `name`, `age`, and `email` as three attributes.
- Complete the `getAge()` method to return the correct `age` value.
