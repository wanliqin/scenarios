# Library Install

Please install the `Faker` library using the pip tool and verify that it has been installed successfully.

Here is an example to check if Faker was installed successfully:

```python
import faker  # if not installed successfully, will print: ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'faker'
fake = faker.Faker()
print(fake.name())
```

## TODO

- Install `Faker` library by `pip`
