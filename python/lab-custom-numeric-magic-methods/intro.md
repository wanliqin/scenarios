# Custom Numeric Magic Methods

In this tutorial, we will cover Python magic methods related to numeric operations. Magic methods are special methods in Python classes that start and end with double underscores (`__`). They are also known as "dunder" methods (double underscores).

These magic methods allow you to define how instances of your class behave with certain operations, like addition or subtraction.

We'll cover the following sections:

1. Unary Operators
2. Binary Operators
3. In-place Operations

Let's get started!
