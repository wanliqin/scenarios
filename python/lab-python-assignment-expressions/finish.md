# Summary

In this lab, we explored Python Assignment Expressions (walrus operator) through a series of step-by-step examples. We covered basic syntax and usage in conditional statements, loops, and list comprehensions. By now, you should have a good understanding of how to use assignment expressions in your Python code to optimize and simplify complex expressions.

Remember to use the assignment expressions wisely to make your code more readable and efficient. As with any programming feature, it's important not to overuse it, as it may lead to less maintainable code if used excessively or inappropriately.

Keep practicing and experimenting with the walrus operator in different scenarios to improve your Python programming skills. Good luck, and happy coding!
