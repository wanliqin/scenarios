# Python Assignment Expressions

In this lab, we will learn about Python Assignment Expressions, also known as the "walrus operator" (`:=`). This operator, introduced in Python 3.8, allows you to assign a value to a variable as part of an expression. It is particularly useful for optimizing code, avoiding redundant calculations, and simplifying complex expressions.

By the end of this lab, you should be able to understand and apply the assignment expressions in your Python programs. We will start with simple examples and gradually progress to more complex ones.
